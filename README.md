<p><strong>About the mod</strong></p>

<p>I created this script in the intention of making the minimap more &quot;alive&quot;, to be honest at this stage it is something very simple, with a display mechanic that works as follows: when the player is inside a helicopter the location of all helipads present in the game will appear on the map, with an animation that resembles the airport beacons.</p>
